<strong>Svelte</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>

### The changes

For the first time I used Tailwind CSS!
Thats probably the reason why it kinda looks off.
But the big changes are in the code:
I reduced the amount of code by <strong>707</strong> lines!
Before with html, css and js I had <strong>837</strong> lines
of code and now with svelte and tailwind(I mean
only the +page.svelte and the +layout.svelte, what I wrote myself) I
only have <strong>130</strong> lines of code!
